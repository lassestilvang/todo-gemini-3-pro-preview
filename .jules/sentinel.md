## 2026-01-25 - [Critical] IDOR in Server Actions
**Vulnerability:** Server Actions (e.g. `getTasks`) accepted `userId` as an argument and trusted it blindly, allowing any user to access/modify any other user's data by guessing their ID.
**Learning:** Exported "use server" functions are public API endpoints. Arguments must not be trusted for authorization.
**Prevention:** Use a central `requireUser(userId)` helper that validates the session user matches the requested resource owner at the start of every sensitive Server Action.
